# React Vite starter

This project serves as a starting point for a React project with Vite. It includes a few libraries and tools that I like to use. You are of course free to use this as a template for your own projects, but I make no guarantees that it will work for you. Some things may be quite opinionated.


### Todo
- [ ] Better readme ðŸ˜…
- [x] lint-staged
- [ ] storybook

- [ ] animation library (framer motion)
- [x] layout system -> use child routes to ensure the navbar doesn't get replaced

## Won't do
- [ ] Auth with Kinde (too specific)
- [ ] i18n (overkill for a starter)
- [ ] Dockerfile with nginx (too specific - is it?)
